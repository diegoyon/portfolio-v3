      <p>
        Hello! My name is Diego and I enjoy creating things that live on the
        internet. My interest in web development started back in 2018 when I
        decided to try out for my first school project — turns out putting
        together a simple website taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

        I’ve had the privilege of working with some experienced professionals
        which has enhanced my skills and rate of learning. My main focus these
        days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences,
        as well as creating designs and illustrations. With my experience I have
        what it takes to solve real world problems
